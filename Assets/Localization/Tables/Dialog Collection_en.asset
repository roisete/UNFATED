    m_Localized: Quickly, there's no time. You must collect the three orbs that seal
      the entrance to these ruins. For the green orb, you must enter the forest and
      find the key it hides; for the blue orb|| you must defeat the most fearsome
      of enemies. Finally, for the red orb, you must solve the riddle of the basin.
      Dangerous monsters will appear on your way, but you can rest|| at the fountains
      found in these ruins. Be careful, young man, you are our only hope.
